# Some advises to facilitate a coding dojo.

We have identified three main areas to take into account to prepare a coding dojo.


### Preparing it.
* Prepare the kata with different approaches, object oriented, functional oriented, inside-out, outside-in, etc.

* While doing the exercise be focused in doing it with baby steps and as many commits as you can. That will be useful for the attendants and yourself the day of the kata.

* Facilitate with examples the creation of the exercise scaffolding without providing any solution. For instance you can create a simple test in different programming languages and the attendants without experience in testing might use it as a guide.

### Organizing it.

* Provide detailed instructions about the place where the coding dojo will be. Minimize the difficulties to access the building / office / etc.

* It will be necessary an internet connection available for the attendants.

* Provide notebooks or sheets and pens, the attendants will need them.

* It would be awesome to have some chargers available for the attendants' laptops.


### Doing it.

* Present yourself and the facilitators.

* Explain the purpose of the coding dojo. In our case is to learn, have fun and share knowledge.

* It is important to remark that the target of the kata is not to finish it but improve the skills and the technique we use.

* Maybe it is convenient to ask the attendants witch is the programming language they are going to use and do a little poll about which ones are familiar in unit testing and tdd.

* Divide the attendants in pairs and if it possible with a pair they have not coded before. No one should be alone, it is ok to have a group with 3 people.

* Explain the exercise and the rules. This point is very important to avoid confusions.

* Do pauses each 30 minutes or so in the middle of the kata to ask about problems or doubts.

* When the kata finishes it is really useful to have a retrospective to share ideas, solutions and insights.

* Ask about if any pair want to show the code to the rest of the people. You can show your own code.
