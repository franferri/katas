## Gilded Rose Kata

A great introduction to it was written by Rachel M. C., she nails in the article the spirit of this kata, with great references too. https://rachelcarmena.github.io/2019/04/13/refactoring.html (but she is far from finishing it, and basically does a plain procedural approach and stops in the middle to suggest polimorphism (oop) to solve some conditionals (if's), feels weird for me since she was doing a procedural approach.)

In this repo I did the Kata in oop and procedural, the key principles for me were to achive the simplest upgradable and redable code possible, as the kata states for future new items additions in the shop.

Also I've covered all the existent business logic with tests for every single business case described on it.

## If you are going to do it yourself, solo, to help you, follow the next instructions.

Start the Kata in your environment, and work on it for 25-45 minutes.

When acting as facilitator, in a event, I will be checking constantly the people code, their progress, and after that first 25-45 minutes time I will proceed to suggest some ideas.

Open the following link after your first 25-45m of working in the kata code: [Suggested refactors](suggested_refactors.md)
