## If you are going to do it yourself, solo, to help you, follow the next instructions.

Start the Kata in your environment, and work on it for 25-45 minutes.

As a facilitator, in a normal event, I will be checking constantly the people code, their progress, and after that first 25-45 minutes time I will proceed to suggest some ideas.

Open the following link after your first 25-45m of working in the kata code: [Suggested refactors](suggested_refactors.md)
